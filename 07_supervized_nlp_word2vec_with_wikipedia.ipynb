C++11 introduced a standardized memory model, but what exactly does that mean?

We are going to\\n  optimize it without breaking the\\n  following assumptions people are going\\n  to make in the code,\" Sutter said.\\n\\nWell, I can memorize this and similar paragraphs available online (as I've had my own memory model since birth :P) and can even post as an answer to questions asked by others, but to be honest, I don't exactly understand this.\\nC++ programmers used to develop multi-threaded applications even before, so how does it matter if it's POSIX threads, or Windows threads, or C++11 threads? What are the benefits? I want to understand the low-level details.\\nI also get this feeling that the C++11 memory model is somehow related to C++11 multi-threading support, as I often see these two together. If it is, how exactly? Why should they be related?\\nAs I don't know how the internals of multi-threading work, and what memory model means in general, please help me understand these concepts. :-)\\n</td>\n",

I work at The National Museum of Computing, and we have just managed to get a Cray Y-MP EL super computer from 1992 running, and we really want to see how fast it can go!\\nWe decided the best way to do this was to write a simple C program that would calculate prime numbers and show how long it took to do so, then run the program on a fast modern desktop PC and compare the results.\\nWe quickly came up with this code to count prime numbers:\\n\\nWhich on our dual core laptop running Ubuntu (The Cray runs UNICOS), worked perfectly, getting 100% CPU usage and taking about 10 minutes or so. When I got home I decided to try it on my hex-core modern gaming PC, and this is where we get our first issues.\\nI first adapted the code to run on Windows since that is what the gaming PC was using, but was saddened to find that the process was only getting about 15% of the CPU's power. I figured that must be Windows being Windows, so I booted into a Live CD of Ubuntu thinking that Ubuntu would allow the process to run with its full potential as it had done earlier on my laptop.\\nHowever I only got 5% usage! So my question is, how can I adapt the program to run on my gaming machine in either Windows 7 or live Linux at 100% CPU utilisation? Another thing that would be great but not necessary is if the end product can be one .exe that could be easily distributed and ran on Windows machines.\\nThanks a lot!\\nP.S.

       "      <td>Is string interning really useful? I was having a conversation about strings and various languages a while back, and the topic of string interning came up.  Apparently Java and the .NET framework do this automatically with all strings, as well as several scripting languages.  Theoretically, it saves memory because you don't end up with multiple copies of the same string, and it saves time because string equality comparisons are a simple pointer comparison instead of an O(N) run through each character of the string.\\nBut the more I think about it, the more skeptical I grow of the concept's benefits.  It seems to me that the advantages are mostly theoretical:\\n\\nFirst off, to use automatic string interning, all strings must be immutable, which makes a lot of string processing tasks harder than they need to be. (And yes, I've heard all the arguments for immutability in general. That's not the point.)\\nEvery time a new string is created, it has to be checked against the string interning table, which is at least a O(N) operation. (EDIT: Where N is the size of the string, not the size of the table, since this was confusing people.)  So unless the ratio of string equality comparisons to new string creation is pretty high, it's unlikely that the net time saved is a positive value.\\nIf the string equality table uses strong references, the strings will never get garbage collected when they're no longer needed, thus wasting memory.  On the other hand, if the table uses weak references, then the string class requires some sort of finalizer to remove the string from the table, thus slowing down the GC process.  (Which could be pretty significant, depending on how the string intern table is implemented. Worst case, deleting an item from a hash table can require an O(N) rebuild of the entire table under certain circumstances.)\\n\\nThis is just the result of me thinking about implementation details.  Is there something I've missed? Does string interning actually provide any significant benefits in the general case?\\nEDIT 2: All right, apparently I was operating from a mistaken premise.  The person I was talking to never pointed out that string interning was optional for newly-created strings, and in fact gave the strong impression that the opposite was true.

That makes it impossible to have a sidebar longer than the main content and having a sticky footer without getting problems when shrinking the browser window.\\nThe status quo:\\nI have a html page with a , which is automatically stretched to fill the screen. So if there is empty space below the element, I stretch it downwards:\\n\\nBut if the browser viewport is smaller than the  itself, no stretching is done but the scrollbar shows up:\\n\\nI've attached jQuery to the window's resize event to resize the , if the browser window is not to small and remove any resizing in the other case.

But if I shrink the browser window, there are cases, where the  should be resized but the  is larger than the 's height, why my script assumes, that no resizing is needed and the 's resizing is removed.  \\nThe point is actually, that if I check the 's height using Firebug after the bug appeared, the height has just the value is was meant to have.

Also you can watch the  output and you will notice, that in the case of \"flickering\" the 's height and the 's height are different instead of being equal.  \\nI've noticed this behavior in Firefox 7, IE 9, Chrome 10 and Safari 5.1.

Description\\nWith the fast approaching removal of synchronous  (i.e.: Chrome 88 is removing this), I am looking for the next optimal alternative method to precache a video.\\n\\n\"Sychronous XMLHttpRequest is a horrible idea\" -\\nsaid no one ever\\n\\nYes, you're right for most scenarios but this is different.\\nPreviously\\nOn android and ios, the company I work for has an SDK that opens a webview in the background, injects HTML into it and waits for the  event to fire. This notifies the SDK when the webview is ready to be shown to the user.\\nIt is imperative that when a video plays there is NO buffering whatsoever for the best possible experience.\\nThis is why when the webview is loading in the background, we precache the video synchronously with XMLHttpRequest (which by consequence, delays the  event from being fired).\\nPossible solutions\\nWe've thought about some different solutions, and they each have their pros and cons; here are a few:\\n\\nPreload content via \\nEmbed the video within the  page in base64 (if the video weights 2-3Mo, it'll weigh 30% more after converting to base64)\\n\\n(1) is the cleanest method, but requires some heavy changes on our backend for various reasons. There is also no guarantee that the video will be fully cached by the time the browser/webview appears. There is no guarantee that the priority of the precaching will be the same across webviews and mobile browsers. Users can deactivate the precaching features, for example, in their Chrome configuration. It also does not work when the connection is 4G or lower (sigh).\\n(2) is a hacky and unoptimized method but is relatively simple to implement compared to (1)\\nQuestion\\nWhat is the next best method to precache a video in the background of a webview/mobile browser that:\\n\\nGuarantees (or closely guarantees) no buffering when the video is played\\nIs done within webview/browser\\nIs (preferably) cross mobile browser/webview compatible\\n(preferably and not required) delays the  event from being triggered\\n\\nNote: not all users may have a 4g or wifi connection.\\nNote2:  tag is in autoplay\\n</td>\n",
